## Overview
1. **Universe Selection (Daily)**  
Every day, the algorithm filters the entire US Equity market to select a "Universe" of 30 stocks to monitor.

- **Price Filter:** Stocks must be priced between $2.50 and $350.00.  
- **Volume Filter:** Stocks must have a daily Dollar Volume greater than $6,700,000.  
- **Ranking:** It sorts the passing stocks by Dollar Volume and keeps the top 30.

2. **Data Collection & IV Caching (Real-Time)**  
Once the universe is selected, the algorithm subscribes to the Option Chains for these 30 stocks.

- **Option Filter:** It looks for "Front Month" contracts within +/- 10 strikes of the current price.  
- **IV Extraction:** On every data tick, it scans the option chains to find a specific contract:  
  - **Type:** Call Option.  
  - **Liquidity:** Must have Volume or Open Interest > 0.  
  - **Expiration:** Between 7 and 39 days out (with a fallback logic to find contracts near 23 days if none exist).  
  - **Strike:** At-The-Money (closest to current stock price).  
- **Caching:** It extracts the Implied Volatility (IV) from this specific contract and saves it to `self.iv_cache`.

3. **Scheduled Screening (Weekly)**  
The actual decision to trade happens once a week, scheduled for Mondays at 10:00 AM.

A. **Market Regime Check**  
Before looking at specific stocks, it checks the overall market health using the VIX (Volatility Index).

- If VIX > 20.50, the market is deemed "BEAR". The algorithm halts and does not open new trades.  
- If VIX ≤ 20.50, it proceeds as a "BULL" market.

B. **Candidate Filtering**  
It takes the 30 stocks from the universe and filters them based on Volatility behavior:

- **Initial Run:** It considers all stocks in the cache.  
- **Subsequent Runs:** It compares the current IV to the previous week's IV. It only keeps stocks where the IV has increased.

C. **Sentiment Filter (Call/Put Ratio)**  
For the remaining candidates, it calculates a sentiment score using the option chain:

- It sums the total Volume of Calls and Puts.  
- It calculates the Call/Put Ratio.  
- **Condition:** The stock is only selected if the Ratio ≥ 1.10 (indicating bullish sentiment).

D. **Ranking**  
The passing stocks are ranked by their IV metric (highest absolute IV on the first run, or highest IV increase on subsequent runs).  
The algorithm selects the Top 15 stocks from this ranked list.

4. **Execution**  
The algorithm iterates through the Top 15 selected stocks.

- **Asset Class:** Despite “LEAPs” (options) being mentioned in the strategy name, the code executes `self.SetHoldings(symbol, ...)`, which buys the underlying stock (Equity).  
- **Sizing:** It allocates 2% of the portfolio to each position.  
- **Constraints:** It stops buying if the total equity allocation exceeds the maximum portfolio limit (set to 1.6, or 160% leverage, though individual position sizing limits this naturally).

5. **Position Management (Real-Time)**  
Once a trade is open, it is managed continuously in `OnData`:

- **Stop Loss:** Liquidates if the position loses 15% (-0.15).  
- **Take Profit:** Liquidates if the position gains 33% (0.33).  
- **Daily Loss Limit:** If the entire portfolio drops by 5% in a single day, it liquidates all positions and halts trading for the day.

**Status**: ✅ Live [Paper] trading December 2025 | Almost ready for production | Major Issue : IV data not received by definition for trading

The strategy demonstrates multiple risk management failures:

1. **Inadequate Drawdown Controls**  
   The portfolio experiences **8–10% maximum drawdowns** repeatedly without apparent circuit breakers.  
   The **March 2025 drawdown (-10.23%)** is particularly concerning as it represents the most recent performance, suggesting regime changes aren't being detected.

2. **No Regime-Based Filtering**  
   The strategy trades indiscriminately across all market conditions, as evidenced by **0% win rates** in consecutive months (**August–September 2023**, **March 2025**).  
   For a 50-person hedge fund managing these funds, such volatility is **unacceptable**.

3. **Excessive Beta Exposure**  
   The **average beta of 1.50** indicates the strategy carries **50% more market risk** than the S&P 500 while simultaneously showing **negative alpha** in many periods.  
   This contradicts the intended **"hedge" positioning**.

## 🏛️ Institutional Suitability Assessment

### **For Pension Funds:** ❌ *Not Suitable*
- **Maximum drawdown of 10.4%** exceeds prudent policy limits.  
- **Inconsistent Sharpe ratio** makes risk projection impossible.  
- Requires minimum **Sharpe ≥ 2.5** and **Max Drawdown 3–5%.**

---

### **For Endowments:** ⚠️ *Not Suitable (Initially)*
- Long-term commitments require **3–5% maximum drawdown.**  
- **3-year lookback** shows insufficient consistency.  
- Would require **18–24 months** of improved performance before consideration.

---

### **For High-Net-Worth Individuals:** 🟡 *Conditional Suitability*
- Suitable only for investors with **>$50M net worth** and tolerance for **15%+ drawdowns.**  
- Allocation should **not exceed 2%** of investable assets.  
- Requires **monthly risk reporting** and **kill-switch mechanisms.**

---

### **For Hedge Fund of Funds:** 🔍 *Research Only*
- Would be classified as an **“Emerging Manager”** or **“Incubation Strategy.”**  
- Typical allocation: **0.5–1%** with **3-month termination clause.**  
- Requires **12-month track record** at current size before increase.

## 🧠 Recommendations for Improvement

### **Priority 1 – Implement Immediately** *(Address Existential Risks)*

#### **1. Add Market Regime Filter**
- Reduce position size **by 50%** when **S&P 500 VIX > 25.**  
- Add **correlation filter:** reduce exposure when **equity correlations > 0.8.**  
- Implement **trend filter:** reduce exposure when major indices fall below **50-day MA.**  
- **Expected improvement:** eliminate *3–4 of 8 drawdown periods.*

#### **2. Establish Hard Stop-Loss Rules**
- **Max loss per trade:** 1% of account.  
- **Max consecutive losses:** 3 before strategy halt.  
- **Daily loss limit:** 2% triggers end-of-day liquidation.  
- **Monthly loss limit:** 5% triggers position reduction.

#### **3. Implement Volatility-Based Position Sizing**
- Link trade size to realized volatility (*e.g., ATR scaling*).  
- Reduce size by **25%** after each consecutive loss.  
- Implement **risk-parity** across signal groups.  
- **Expected improvement:** reduce maximum intra-trade drawdown from **-42% → -15%.**

---

### **Priority 2 – Implement Within 3 Months** *(Operational Excellence)*

#### **1. Risk Monitoring Dashboard**
- Real-time **daily drawdown tracking** with **+2% alert threshold.**  
- Weekly **Sharpe ratio** calculation and trend analysis.  
- Monthly **heat map** of win rate, Sharpe, and return metrics.  
- Rolling **3-month and 12-month performance** assessments.

#### **2. Fee Structure Optimization**
- Current returns (0.5–1.5% monthly) **cannot support 2/20 structure.**  
- Recommend: **0.5% management fee + 15% performance fee** with a **high-water mark.**  
- Implement **clawback provisions** for drawdown recovery periods.

#### **3. Liquidity & Leverage Constraints**
- Ensure **max leverage ≤ 2.0x.**  
- Maintain **20% cash buffer** for redemptions and margin calls.  
- Limit any **single position <5%** of portfolio.

---

### **Priority 3 – Implement Within 6 Months** *(Competitive Positioning)*

#### **1. Alpha Enhancement Through Ensemble Methods**
- Implement **voting mechanism** requiring 2+ signals to confirm trades.  
- Weight signals by their **recent Sharpe contribution.**  
- Add **independent confirmation** from a distinct technical approach.  
- **Expected improvement:** Sharpe ratio from **1.8 → >2.5.**

#### **2. Multi-Asset Class Diversification**
- Reduce **single-asset dependency.**  
- Expand to **3–5 related markets** through a systematic approach.  
- Target **beta reduction from 1.50 → <1.10.**  
- **Expected improvement:** Negative Sharpe months reduced **from 8 → <3.**
