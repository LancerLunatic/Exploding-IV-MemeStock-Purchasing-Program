# Summary
I created this to showcase my capabilities as a full cycle quantitative developer and trader. I am open to quant trader/quant dev/quant analyst roles with hybrid in-office style in Washington, DC, NYC and surrounding areas. I have been trading manually all asset classes starting with stocks in 2011.
I like they concept of algorithmic trading because I know my trade plan/rules will always be followed where as a human can deviate due to ego.
